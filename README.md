# kylie-nodejs

A simple website implemented using Node.js, with Express. Intended to be deployed as an example application onto OpenShift.

A fork of the [sclorg/nodejs-ex](https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex) repo, because I'm still learning Node.js ðŸ¤¡

## Developing

To run locally:

    npm install
    npm start

Now access the website on http://localhost:8080
